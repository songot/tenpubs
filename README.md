# Top 10 Publications Project
The project is written in Python and has been tested from 3.7.3 version. It uses trending news API “executium” to scrape data with articles published on the selected date and price change among the existing pairs.

#### The purpose of this project
Help traders and trading journalists in their discovering of correlations between publications and try to give them insightful information about news price impact.

    ```bash
    pip install pycurl certifi
    ```

#### The desired result
The program should present a scatter chart and a list with ten ranked publications and counted percentage of price impact. Also the application should allow user to set a date and currency pair. 

#### Installation guide

#### Authentication keys
For the parts which do not require a `subscription` you do not need to add a `key` or `secret`. These can be obtained via executium.com if required.
